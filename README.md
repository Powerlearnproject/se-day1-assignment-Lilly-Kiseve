Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software.
Software engineering is important because it provides a structured approach to develop reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions that meet the evolving needs of businesses and users.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The birth of software engineering 1960s-in the 1960s software develoment was still considered an art rather than engineering discipline.
The rise of structured programming 1970s-the concept of structured programming was introduced by Edsger Dijkstra and others.
The agile movement (1990s-2000s)-agile movement began to take shape, challenging traditional, rigid methodologies like the waterfall model.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning-define the projects requirement and goal.
Design-create the applications architecture and prototype.
Development-build the application using the design specifications.
Testing-ensure the application functions as intented and mets quality standards.
Maintenance-update and support the application overtime.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows a linear, sequential approach where each project phase must be completed before moving to the next while agile is an iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the development process making it much more flexible in handling changing requrements. examples;waterfall-building a well defined structure like a large building.
agile-used for developing a software application where a customer needs might evolve during development.example;-developing a mobile app.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality assurance engineer- ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project manager- oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs-software suites tha provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and tesing code. for example - visual studio.
version control systems- software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. example;-git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges include; -changing requirements, tight deadlines, technical debt.
strategies to overcome challenges; - effective communication, Agile methodologies, proritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing-testing interaction between different components or subsystems.
System testing- testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing- testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user need.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting instrctions known as prompts to guide a generative AI model towards producing the most desired and relevant output by providing  specific details and context in natural language.
its importance is to allow users to effectively communicate their intent to an AI model.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt- write something about animals
improved prompts - write a 300 word article about the conservation status of tigers in the wild, including current threats they face and ongoing efforts to protect them.
The improved prompt is more effective because it helps the writer know exactly what information is needed, reducing the chances of irrelevant content and improving the quality of the response.
